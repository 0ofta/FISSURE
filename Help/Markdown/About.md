# FISSURE - The RF Framework
**Frequency Independent SDR-based Signal Understanding and Reverse Engineering**

FISSURE is a modular and extensible software framework designed to greatly speed the identification of vulnerabilities in RF protocols, waveforms, and devices. FISSURE is capable of integrating existing, state-of-the-art, and next generation tools, analysis techniques, and algorithms to bridge the Cyber/EW gap and support RF device assessment. 

FISSURE provides a means to dig deep into a target's operation and stress the basic features of the system to identify flaws in design and implementation. FISSURE supports multiple types of RF hardware and reuses existing analysis tools developed by the cyber community to give operators more flexibility and an instant sense of familiarity. 

The FISSURE framework is extensible and could be inter-operable with other developed capabilities relating to:
- Signal Detection & Classification
- Demodulation & Protocol Deconstruction
- Target Identification and Vulnerability Analysis
- Protocol Discovery
- Signal Injection and Packet Crafting
- Pattern Recognition
- Blind Signal Separation
- Frequency Hopping Characterization
- Advanced Fuzzing Techniques
- IQ Data Analysis
